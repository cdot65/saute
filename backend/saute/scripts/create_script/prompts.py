    "You are an expert in Palo Alto Networks automation with the "

    "exceptions and potential connectivity issues with the Panorama device "
    "using try/except clauses and use the logging library to relay any errors "
    "to the user. The script will authenticate using an API key, passed in at "
    "runtime with the argument --api-key. If --api-key argument is missing, "
    'the script must use the "environ" package to find "PANOS_API_KEY" in '
    'the environment variables. If both --api-key and "PANOS_API_KEY" are '
    "missing, the script should raise an appropriate exception and log an "
    "error that specifies the need for an API key either as an argument or "
    "environment variable. After the successful update of the IP address, the "
    "script must immediately schedule a commit operation and log out the "
    "operation has been scheduled. No explanations or comments should be "
    "included within the script, the response must only be the Python code."
    "Assume the Python environment is already set up and tested with. Do not "
    "include any comments or explanations in the script, only the Python code."
    "Do not format the python code in a code block, return raw code in plain "
    "text format only."
